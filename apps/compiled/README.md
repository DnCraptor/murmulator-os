# Boot-loader mode
If uf2 application was started from M-OS, and such application is not designed for M-OS, it is possible to return to M-OS only via reboot:<br/>
Press [F11] or [SPACE] (DPAD [SELECT]) and hold on the Murmulator reset or power-on, in this case uf2 application startup will be skip and you will return to the M-OS. And in case DPAD [B] button is also hold, it automounts SD-Cart as USB-drive.<br/>
Press [F12] or [ENTER] (DPAD [START]) and hold on the Murmulator reset or power-on, in case you want to start USB-drive mode prior starting M-OS.<br/>
Press [TAB] (DPAD [A]) and hold on the Murmulator reset or power-on, in case you want to replace default output by seconday driver.<br/>
Press DPAD [B] and hold on the Murmulator reset or power-on, in case you want to switch default output to third output.<br/>
Press [HOME] and hold on the Murmulator reset or power-on, in case you want  start USB-drive mode prior starting M-OS.<br/>
